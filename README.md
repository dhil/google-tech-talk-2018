# Materials for my Google Tech Talk 2018

The directory `live/` contains skeleton programs that I completed during the
talk. The directory `examples/` contains the complete programs as well as
additional examples.

The examples are intended to be run using [Multicore
OCaml](https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-multicore) version 4.06.1.
